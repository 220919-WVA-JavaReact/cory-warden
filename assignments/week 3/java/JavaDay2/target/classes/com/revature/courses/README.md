# Today's goals

Build a basic console app for teachers to register to sign up for teaching classes.

- Access to register/login as teacher
- Access to enroll to teach a course
- Information should be persisted to a csv file or similar.


Teachers.csv: id, firstName, lastName, username, pw
Courses.csv: courseNum, courseName, authId
