REACT
    - JS Library to make creative UI
        - lightweight 
            - meant to be used with other modules of the user's choice(ie. React Router)
        - React DOM, React Native, React VR
    - Declarative
        - Using React, we describe the desired state using JSX
            - React handles the rest
    - Library, NOT a framework.
        - Frameworks (like VUE or Angular) have their "right way" of doing things.
            - "forced" to do things the way they want
            - "forced" to use their dependencies
            - Frameworks generally "call your code" (IoC)
    - Component based architecture
        - breaking down a UI into small chunks of code that are reusable
            - inject/remove views and functionality of the same page rather than requesting a new one.
        - Single Page Application (SPA)
            - Design Pattern
            - no longer need to fully reload the web page with another view (only need one view)
            - web pack
                - static module bundler for modern JS applications
    - Virtual DOM
        - used to render elements more efficiently than tradition DOM Manipulation
        - keeps virtual views in emmory
            - updates/changes made are compatred to the virtual dom representation in memory
            - the differential is calculated - Reconciliation
            - only the necessary changes are made to the DOM
